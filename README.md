## Usage

To use this project, you can interact with the simple front-end that is available on the [project-foodhunter-frontend](https://github.com/tonaczew/project-foodhunter-frontend) repository. Once you have navigated to the front-end, you can use the following steps to create a shopping list:

1. Start by adding items to the list by typing them in and pressing "Enter".
2. Continue adding items until you are satisfied with your list.
3. Once your list is complete, click the "Ready" button to mark it as complete.
4. Click the "Get Price" button to get the prices for the items on your list.
5. If you want to start over, you can click the "Clear" button to clear the page and start again.

That's it! Once you have completed these steps, you should have a list of items with their corresponding prices.

## Version 1.0
This is the first version of the Food Hunter project, which currently supports two stores:

- Hemk√∂p
- Ica Maxi Lindhagen

In future versions of the project, we plan to expand the number of stores that are supported. However, for now, we hope that this limited selection will still be useful to you.
